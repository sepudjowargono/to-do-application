# ✅ Python To-Do List CLI Application

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly **Command Line Interface (CLI) To-Do List Application** built using Python.

The purpose of this assignment was to practice and strengthen core Python concepts including:

- 🧠 Functions  
- 🔁 Loops  
- 🔀 Conditionals  
- 📦 Lists  
- ⚠️ Error handling (`try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`)  
- 🖥️ User input validation  

The application allows users to add, view, and delete tasks directly from the terminal.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Features

### 📝 Add Tasks
- Users can enter a new task.
- Prevents empty tasks from being added.
- Stores tasks in a Python list.

### 📋 View Tasks
- Displays all tasks in numbered format.
- Alerts the user if the list is empty.

### 🗑️ Delete Tasks
- Allows deletion by task number.
- Validates input to prevent crashes.
- Handles:
  - Non-numeric input
  - Invalid task numbers
  - Empty task list

### 🔄 Main Menu Navigation
- Displays a user-friendly menu.
- Validates menu selections.
- Continues running until user chooses to quit.

### ⚠️ Error Handling
- Uses `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.
- Prevents program crashes due to invalid user input.
- Provides clear feedback messages to users.

## ▶️ How to Run the Application

### 1️⃣ Make sure Python is installed

Check your Python version:

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

---

### 2️⃣ Run the program

In your terminal (inside the project folder), run:

```bash
python todo_app.py
```

If that doesn't work, try:

```bash
python3 todo_app.py
```

---

## 🧪 Example Interaction

```
Welcome to the To-Do App!

MAIN MENU:
1) Add A Task
2) View Tasks
3) Delete A Task
4) Quit Application

Choose an option (1-4):
```

The application will continue running until you choose option 4 to quit.

## 📚 Key Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:

- Writing organized, modular code using functions
- Managing dynamic data using lists
- Validating and sanitizing user input
- Implementing robust error handling
- Building a complete interactive CLI program from scratch
